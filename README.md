## Quick Start

### TLDR

## What is a frontend?
When you visit our website you're interacting with two systems, a frontend application and a backend application. The frontend application (where you are now) is responsible for displaying images, text and data on our web pages.
Frontend applications are usually written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript and utilize one or more frameworks such as Angular, Backbone, Vue, and React. https://operationcode.org uses React.

## What is a backend?
The backend is responsible for providing data to the front end to display, and processing data entered into the frontend, and running various jobs like inviting new users to Slack, or signing them up for our newsletter. The https://operationcode.org backend is written in Rails and can be viewed at https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_backend.
